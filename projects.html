                <span class="highlights">Summary:</span>
                Developed in collaboration with <a href="https://github.com/yeddyfit">yeddyfit</a>, Cheflist is a website that combines recipes and music.
                The user first saves a recipe and then will be asked questions to gauge mood and music preferences and the website will generate a playlist that is relevant to that recipe.
                <br>  <br>
                Cheflist was built using the MERN stack which allows us to write a website entirely in JavaScript and allows us access to the powerful capabilities of the node package manager.

            <a href="https://github.com/andrewtrandev/Portfolio-Website">-> Github project repo</a>
            <p> <span class="highlights">Summary:</span> As an aspiring developer, I'm creating a website portfolio to test and apply knowledge of html and css in 
                practice and also get a nifty portfolio out at the end of it. I'll be able to further develop and refine my 
                skills by continually improving this website.This webste is my portfolio, how meta right?<br><br>
                
                I've focused on a dark aesthetic and clearly legible text. 
                I've modified the website to also be mobile friendly and be accessible to the visually impaired.

                <h2>Ruby Terminal Application</h2>
                <a href="https://github.com/andrewtrandev/Terminal-Project">-> Github project repo</a> 
                <p>I worked on a word game application to run in terminal using the Ruby language. 
                    <br><br>
                    <!--using spans to add highlights to sub-headings -->
                    <span class="highlights">Features: Replay game</span> - a while loop that allows you to continue to play again by selecting either yes/no.

                    Limited it to just a menu select for yes/no so that user can't enter other commands and inputs are sanitized.<br><br>

                    <span class="highlights">Accruing point system</span> - points earned will carry over to future games in the instance. 
                    Adds the score onto a variable outside the while loop so that the score doesn't get reset each time the game goes 
                    through the while loop.<br><br>
                    
                    <span class="highlights">Vowel adder</span> - if number of letters is greater than 6, add more vowels to make the game easier. <br>
                    Done through a method that first checks if the word is less than 6 letters and if so will shuffle at least one vowel in,
                    if the word is greater than 6 letters it'll shuffle at least 2 vowels in. This is done through if/else and shuffling of arrays.<br><br>
                    
                    <span class="highlights">Mismatching letters loop</span> - If user inputs letters that don't equal the output randomized letters then continue running a 
                    while loop that outputs the random letters and prompts them to input letters that match the output randomized letters. 
                    I was initially using delete() but that would delete every instance of a variable and cause errors for words like 'goon'. 
                    Had to delete the specific letter in the array by referencing it's index using .index and also had to make a different array
                    so that it wasn't deleting the original arrays letters.<br><br>
                    
                    <span class="highlights">Scrabble hash</span> - Calculates score using a scrabble hash which values rarer words higher versus the original idea of using 
                    length of the word. Downloaded a 3rd party ruby file and used require_relative to access it's functionality.<br></p>
