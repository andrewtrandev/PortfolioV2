                <h2>Ruby Terminal Application</h2> 
                <p>I worked on a word game application to run in terminal using the Ruby language. 
                    <br><br>
                    <!--using spans to add highlights to sub-headings -->
                    <span class="highlights">Features: Replay game</span> - a while loop that allows you to continue to play again by selecting either yes/no.

                    Limited it to just a menu select for yes/no so that user can't enter other commands and inputs are sanitized.<br><br>

                    <span class="highlights">Accruing point system</span> - points earned will carry over to future games in the instance. 
                    Adds the score onto a variable outside the while loop so that the score doesn't get reset each time the game goes 
                    through the while loop.<br><br>
                    
                    <span class="highlights">Vowel adder</span> - if number of letters is greater than 6, add more vowels to make the game easier. <br>
                    Done through a method that first checks if the word is less than 6 letters and if so will shuffle at least one vowel in,
                    if the word is greater than 6 letters it'll shuffle at least 2 vowels in. This is done through if/else and shuffling of arrays.<br><br>
                    
                    <span class="highlights">Mismatching letters loop</span> - If user inputs letters that don't equal the output randomized letters then continue running a 
                    while loop that outputs the random letters and prompts them to input letters that match the output randomized letters. 
                    I was initially using delete() but that would delete every instance of a variable and cause errors for words like 'goon'. 
                    Had to delete the specific letter in the array by referencing it's index using .index and also had to make a different array
                    so that it wasn't deleting the original arrays letters.<br><br>
                    
                    <span class="highlights">Scrabble hash</span> - Calculates score using a scrabble hash which values rarer words higher versus the original idea of using 
                    length of the word. Downloaded a 3rd party ruby file and used require_relative to access it's functionality.<br></p>

            <h2>Web Portfolio</h2>
            <p>As an aspiring developer, I'm creating a website portfolio to test and apply knowledge of html and css in 
                practice and also get a nifty portfolio out at the end of it. I'll be able to further develop and refine my 
                skills by continually improving this website.This webste is my portfolio, how meta right?<br><br>
                
                I've focused on a dark aesthetic and clearly legible text. 
                I've modified the website to also be mobile friendly and be accessible to the visually impaired.
                This portfolio is aimed at potential employers or clients. The blog section could also be targeted at anyone 
                wishing to know what my journey through a coding bootcamp looks like i.e potential bootcamp students.</p>
