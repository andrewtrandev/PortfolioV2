### Purpose
As an aspiring developer, I'm creating a website portfolio to test and apply knowledge of html and css in practice and also get a nifty portfolio out at the end of it. I'll be able to further develop and refine my skills by continually improving this website. 

I've modified the website to also be mobile friendly and be accessible to the visually impaired.

### Functionality/Features
- Clean visuals
- Dark aesthetic
- Working Navigation Bar that highlights which section of the website you're in
- Brand name should take you home
- Mobile responsiveness for all webpages
- Animations on icons
- Social Media links
- Contact form
- Resume download
- Blog

#### Notable functions
**The navigation bar**<br>
  An important part of the website that should allow the user to easily navigate the website. The navigation bar should also clearly indicate where a user is within the website by highlighting which section of the website they're in on the nav bar. It should 
  also be mobile responsive and condense into a smaller format when disaplyed on smaller devices. 

  **Mobile Responsiveness**<br>
  Webpages should scale for smaller devices through media queries and flexbox/css grid. Images should also scale down and elements should be centered for a better user experience.

  **Dark aesthetic and clean visuals**<br>
  Staring at pure white webpages gets tiring after some time and so I wanted a dark theme that was easy on the eyes.
  
  **General Interactivity**
  Links (navigation bar, resume download) should respond to the user hovering over them. This doesn't have to be a huge animation and may help users in finding clickable links and provide a more stimulating user experience.

### Mockups and youtube

I also watched some videos on youtube and did code-alongs to get an idea of how
other people went about designing a website and laying out their html/css. 
This was an integral part of my designing phase as I was at a loss to how to begin coding or structuring my site. This also helped me solidify concepts and get an idea of what was possible.

### Mobile Responsiveness

I tackled the issue of mobile responsiveness by using the developer tools in chrome to simulate different screen sizes. Most things could be scaled down well through wrapping of elements or collapsing grids of two columns to one.But some issues I had to deal with by using media queries to manually adjust elements which isn't ideal.

Used colormind to autogenerate some colour schemes. I played around with alot of colours and eventually came to the below colour scheme.
